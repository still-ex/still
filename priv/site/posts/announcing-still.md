# Still on Elixir

We are proud to announce Still! A static site generator for Elixir.

It isn't a secret that Still is inspired by Eleventy. We feel that
Eleventy is a step in the right direction, but there's still too much
JavaScript on it. After many years of makign static webites, we felt that
there must be something in between jekkyl or middleman and gatsby. Our
intention is to make something that's simple to get started but easy to
extend.
