      p.p Still is still in early active development. To get started:

      pre.p
        code
          mix archive.install hex still<br />
          mix still.new mysite

      p.p This will create an Elixir project in the folder mysite. Youâ€™ll find an index.slime file inside priv/site.

      p.p Run mix still.dev to start the development server. Then open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to see the new website.
